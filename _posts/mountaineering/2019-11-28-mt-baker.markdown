## Mt. Baker via the North Ridge

I recently got into ice climbing but counter-intuitively signed up for this without having ice climbed ever before. I was motivated 
to make sure that I gain the experience required. I am glad I forced myself to do this because I have realized that my eventual goal is to be
an alpinist. An alpinist is not complete without ice climbing experience after which I can look to graduate towards mixed-climbing. I have my 
sights on Mt. Cook in New Zealand for some mixed-climbing fun! 

Mt. Baker has one of the most striking approaches that I know. Mt. Rainier shares a similar vibe. Baker has a nice hike through the jungles 
that has some stunning views of the valley below at view points. As we approach tree line you get a magnificent view of Mt. Baker, the white
giant and I think part of the reason that it is so striking is its fairly suden appearance as you emerge from the trees. 

I think overall was an amazing experience but I left a lot to be desired in terms of actual performance. My training had neither been adequate
nor targeted leaving me fairly close to red-lining as the guide pushed forward. It was not great that this was the most taxing day I had spent 
in a long time especially one in the mountains. This trip a lot left to be desired and would have been more enjoyable if I were more ready to 
handle it.
