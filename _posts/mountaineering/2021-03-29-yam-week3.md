Hello again friends,


Hope everyone is keeping safe. My mom has been informing me about the COVID situation in India which
is worsening and that the vaccines have not been effective in mitigating the disease spread and
preventing infection amongst the vaccinated individuals either. Sticking to our protocols is the
only reliable tool in our arsenal that we know we have.


Sunrises are stunning to look at and when the conditions are just perfect, I can’t resist taking a
picture even if I have seen the sun rise at the same location before.

Yet another beautiful sunrise


Obviously, I am very lucky that I am able to do this course but one of the more underrated moments
is when I sit down to write my weekly newsletter. I get to take in this view while I reflect on the
past week!

We just had a fresh dumping of snow today


Mother Nature has been our friend on this course so far (hopefully not jinxed by saying that). We
got warm temps and clear weather for the most part during the ice climbing section and a dumping of
snow and lower temperatures as we came into the ski section!


**Ski resort day**

We woke up on the first day of the section with a massive dumping of snow the night before with more
snow continuing to fall.

Best feeling waking up to fresh snow



This was a day for the instructors to figure out the ski skills of the group. By far I was the
weakest skier of the group and while expected, is never a fun place to be in! I had rented skis that
I had never used before and had not skied in about 6 years so was completely overwhelmed. However,
the instructors Grant and Larry helped me deal with the situation and helped me through feeling more
accustomed to the skis again. It was nice to be back at the ski hill though and brought up some
nostalgic memories of skiing with my close friends in college.



**Ski tour day**

The following day we headed up to a mountain called Black Prince. While we didn’t go up to the
summit, we used the region to practice our avalanche rescue drills and ski touring for our upcoming
trip.


The road heading up to the trailhead is a rough one. While Grant was our primary guide, Pat was our
secondary guide and our van driver for the day and he was quite the character. On the ride to the
trailhead, he essentially spoke non-stop for 30 mins and had no dearth of chatter at any point
during the day. He drove us down that bumpy road at 110 km/h screaming that it is a smoother ride if
we go faster over the bumps. And while that may be true, it was a roller coaster at the back with
the sliding on snow and the hard bumps. A ride to remember!

It was a great day out. We had fresh powder to ski on, I crashed on the way down like 3 times
including inventing a new tree hook stopping technique. Grant says I should patent it - its quite
simple really. If you think you’re going too fast, just stick your leg out and hopefully you hook
onto a tree to bring you to a stop - extremely effective but would not recommend.



**Ski tour expedition**

The next few days were spent prepping for the expedition and then heading out. Given my performance
over the past few days, I was extremely nervous but my course mates are great - they helped me calm
my nerves. We started off right next to the Sunshine ski hill (where we went for our ski day)


You might be wondering what ski touring means. Essentially, we use special skis - they use a
different kind of bindings for your shoes that let you transition from ski to walk mode. The ski
mode operates like traditional downhill skis and the walk mode lets you walk around with the skis
and even uphill when you add put skins on the bottom. The skins let the skis slide forward but not
back on snow. This allows you to gain elevation and when you decide to ski down, you simply
transition the skis to ski mode and then you can ski down like normal.

A lot of our time was spent transitioning from ski to walk mode and vice versa



Our plan was to ski up the Healy Creek Trail to the Monarch Ramparts which is the ridge line of
Monarch mountain. Sadly the entire time we were up there, the cloudy skies prevented us from getting
a clear picture of this scenic mountain.

clouds



We spent the first day getting to camp and setting it up. Once we got the kitchen going, everyone
got excited and we started cooking. Much of our time during the mornings and evenings was spent
melting snow into water for cooking and filling up our bottles.

We spent some time setting up our kitchen where we spent most of our trip down time
melting water

Grant and Tak were our guides for this trip and they were awesome. Grant met his wife
Meagan on Everest and had so many amazing personal stories


The next day was spent skiing around the area and exploring the monarch ramparts. We spent a lot of
time on the previous days discussing the avalanche risks which we concluded were low where we would
ski. I spent a lot of my time wiping out skiing downhill and then spending more time going uphill.
It was extremely tiring! But I was able to see gorgeous landscapes while at the top - a teaser for
the upcoming sections.

Skiing along side the towering snow covered trees which was the norm for our ski in and
out


We spent most of yesterday enjoying a hearty breakfast of eggs and hash browns with some bacon and
then skiing via the Healy creek trail. I fell numerous times on the way out but I managed to get out
somehow and without any injuries. Super happy about that! Also Grant, our guide, said that I should
be good enough for the following sections of skiing and I am excited that I can fully partake!


Today is our rest day to organize our things, recover from our weekend activities and get ready for
our trip starting on Wednesday. Next week will be our AST 2 (avalanche safety training level 2)
which will be done while backcountry camping.


Overall its been a relatively rough week with my skiing skills holding me back a bit and exhausting
me more than others because of poor technique. In addition, it has been a fight against my internal
negative voice which has been draining a bit mentally as well. Still an awesome week which included
lots of learning and looking forward to the next week!


Thanks for reading! Stay safe and look out for the next email next week!
