Later 2021 and 2022 was a big year for my climbing. I was able to dial down my trad leading
at the gunks, getting about 20 days of outdoor rock climbing and about 10 days of ice as well. 

I had a great time with James, Miles, Golli, Allen, Andrew, Daniella, Lydia. 

We made sport climbing trip out to Thatcher State Park which was good - managed to get some 9s,
10as but failed on the most epic 10a - Mutt. 

Multiple trips out to the Gunks climbing

- Jackie
- Sixish
- The Ceiling
- Followed up Strictly From Nowhere
- TR on Ants Line
- And a bunch of easier stuff too like Beginners, Minty, Casa Emilio (I am sure I have missed some) 

I also managed to get out ice climbing with Doug (guide) and Ming going up to Chapel Pond and
Pitchoff. We did a bunch of top roping at Pitchoff and did Crystal Ice Tower, Chouinards over at
Chapel Pond. With Wojtek I also climbed Hillyer Ravine which was in stellar shape. 

In Feb/March Alex and I were able to get out for about 2 days to Gore Mountain for some skiing which
was great!

Over the summer around June 2022, I was able to go with Alex back to the beautiful PNW and up to
Squamish area. We spent a few days with the Yam boys and Juliette doing some climbing and up a route
called Slot Machine. Fun stuff. Then headed over to Salt Spring Island and Galiano island for some
well needed rest and relaxation.
