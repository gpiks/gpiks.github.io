\#throwback : December 2018

After our half-iron man in Palm Springs, Jubin and I went for camping in Joshua Tree national park. 
A really unplanned adventure, we dragged our achy muscles and bones around town getting the required
gear and finding a camp site in the park. We were rewarded with the most beautiful sunset that I
have ever experienced, a star studded sky, some real funky rocks and empty roads. Also the eponymous
trees which really added to the surreal experience.
