Currently, I am hunkered down in my apartment but I noticed a beautiful sunset coming on and thought
it was a great opportunity to go and click some pictures. I took this picture which I really liked
because it represents how the subway (and the city by extension) continues to function while many
are affected. The parked taxis are a sign that business is down. But I know that we will prevail,
its just a matter of time. My heart goes out to everyone suffering and also those fighting the the 
good fight on the front lines.
