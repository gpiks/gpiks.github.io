Prelude: What I have written builds on the concepts from Simon Sinek's book, The Infinite Game. I 
would highly recommend giving this a read if you find these thoughts interesting.

Sinek postulates that people have different ways to approach their actions - either by thinking 
about playing an infinite game or a finite one. 

Infinite games are ones that outlast every player in it and has a revolving door of players and 
circumstances, whereas finite games have an end date and as a result can be less dynamic with all 
the factors known. What the technical defintion hides is that this is entirely perception based. 
Players can be playing the same game with either an infinite or finite perception and as a result 
they have very different mindsets. In general, the infinite mindset leads to more long term positive
outcomes for all the stakeholder involved because the infinite player understands that the 

The infinite game mindset is just as valuable to corporations as it is to individuals. The 
more that people stop thinking selfishly about their lives only but expand it to every future 
generation and humanity as a whole, the less we will jeopardize the long term vision for the short 
term benefits. Topics like sustainable living and empathy will be more at the forefront of
people's minds and could lead to a healthier society that is built to survive together for the long 
haul. 

The consequences of our collective approach to life as finite game is everywhere. Governments wildly 
unprepared for a pandemic while knowing about this possibility for years, almost irreversible 
climate change that literally only a world wide virus was able to help with, division and 
polarization of citizens into different camps. These are all signs of short term vision without the 
infinite game mindset. 

Sadly the crux of all of this boils down to one single, difficult to pratice, idea - delayed 
gratification. Finite games and thinking can be addictive and self-reinforcing. With corporations 
abandoning ethics in exchange for profit can lead to high profits and growth in the short term, but 
it compromises the long term outlook of the company's culture, potentially leading to more cut 
throat employees who contribute to a toxic culture which can eventually lead to the company's 
downfall if unchecked. For individuals, thinking only about current ease often sacrifices the long 
term. The riots that we see in the USA are also indicative of the short sightedness. While I am 
absolutely for systemic change, dangerous ideas such as black-only institutions propagate a 
tit-for-tat behavior that signals that lack of vision for the future and the need for drastic and 
immediate justice for the past.
