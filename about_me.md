My name is Gaurav Pikale and I am part software engineer, part climber, part photographer, part 
sailor, part undefined. I worked at Bloomberg as a software infrastructure engineer but am currently 
pursuing a mountain semester with Yamnuska Mountain Adventures in Canmore, Alberta. 

I believe that balance in life and work is something that is unique to each person and the goal of
each and everyone is to find and achieve it. While LinkedIn records my work experience, this website
captures my 'life' and extra curricular experiences. 

If you would like to reach out to me, you can email me at gaurav.pikale@gmail.com.
