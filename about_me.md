My name is Gaurav Pikale and I work at Bloomberg LP as an engineer in the Python Infrastructure
team. I am currently spend most of my work time writing extension libraries for Python and building 
processes for deploying libraries. 

I like the simple things in life and and smelling the metaphoric roses as I go through life. A lot 
of my free time is spent outdoors either sailing or mountaineering. I am trying to ensure that I 
document both my journey and my musings. 

If you would like to reach out to me, you can email me at gaurav.pikale@gmail.com.
