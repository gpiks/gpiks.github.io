The first photo walk that I did was with my iPhone in my first year of engineering. I did look very
out of place that day, but, looking for beauty in the ordinary is a feeling that I feel every time I 
take the camera out, and that feeling has never felt out of place in me. I shoot with a Sony RX 100 
on expeditions and committing climbs and a Sony A6000 when I have the luxury to carry it.
