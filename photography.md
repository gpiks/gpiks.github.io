The first photo walk that I did was with my iPhone in my first year of engineering. I did look very
out of place that day, but, looking for beauty in the ordinary is a feeling that I feel every time I 
take the camera out, and that feeling has never felt out of place in me. I currently am using an 
A6000 with the stock lens with no concrete plans to move up in the camera world. I would be 
interested in a new prime lens, however.
