Sometime in June 2017 I signed up for a mountaineering course with Alpine Ascents on a whim
and I was hooked. Mountaineering and Alpinism appealed to me because not only did it require 
a combination of strength and endurance but also it requires technical ability while climbing 
very steep terrain. Not that I am doing a great job with it, but I try my best to record the trips 
that as a way to document and reflect.
