Sometime in June 2017 I signed up for a mountaineering course with Alpine Ascents on a whim
and I was hooked. Mountaineering and Alpinism appealed to me because not only did it require 
a combination of strength and endurance but also it requires technical ability while climbing 
very steep terrain. I try my best to record some of the trips that I undertake and personally,
is a good way to remember it, but I also hope that it can inspire whoever happens to read it.
